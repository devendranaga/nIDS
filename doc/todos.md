| 1 | design filtering | we need a filtering flow, if we need to filter at the        |
|   |                  | layer itself or beyond after all the content is parsed.      |
|   |                  | There could be a chance that more than one rule can match    |
|   |                  | filters and we need to make a decision on which filter rule  |
|   |                  | finally matched and weather to allow or deny or event frame. |
