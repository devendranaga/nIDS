| 1 | design filtering | we need a filtering flow, if we need to filter at the        |
|   |                  | layer itself or beyond after all the content is parsed.      |
|   |                  | There could be a chance that more than one rule can match    |
|   |                  | filters and we need to make a decision on which filter rule  |
|   |                  | finally matched and weather to allow or deny or event frame. |
| 2 | design ips       | we need to understand this more to define port maps first.   |
| 3 | parse tcp options   | |
| 4 | parse icmp6 options | |
| 5 | parse ipv6 options | |
| 6 | icmp deny on packets with 0 bytes | |
| 7 | parse tftp frames |
| 8 | parse ipv6 extensions | |
| 9 | udp checksum validation | |

| 20 | must compress event log after write | |
| 21 | use gz to support compression | |
| 22 | match tcp / udp data portion content for known exploit names |
| 23 | match icmp data portion content for known exploit names |
| 24 | parse ipv4 strict source route |
